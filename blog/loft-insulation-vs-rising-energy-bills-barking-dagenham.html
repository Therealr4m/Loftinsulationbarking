<h1> Loft Insulation vs Rising Energy Bills in Barking & Dagenham (2025 statistics) </h1>
<p> 
 Energy bills in Barking & Dagenham have shown a staggering increase over the past 2–3 years, and the biggest contributor for many households is heat loss through the roof. 

This article will compare 2 things side by side:
	1.	How much energy bills have risen
	2.	How much heat loss you can prevent with proper loft insulation in 2026
      </p>

      <H2> Energy Bills in Barking & Dagenham Are Actually Rising Faster Than the UK Average </H2>
      <p> Across London boroughs, energy bills have risen around 18–22% between the years of 2022 and 2024, and that is according to insights from Ofgem and the Energy Saving Trust. That is significantly higher than the national average increase.
      
        Most importantly to local homeowners in Barking & Dagenham, where a lot of properties are much older, homes built pre-1990 lose up to 25% of heat through the roof when the loft insulation is too thin or outdated.
       Because Barking & Dagenham has one of the highest proportions of older housing stock in East London, it means homeowners here get affected much harder than homeowners in other areas in terms of their energy costs.
       <p> on one of our blogs you can find phrase <strong>"Heat loss through the roof"</strong> that can be found here:<a href="../why-insulate-your-loft.html">Why You Should Insulate Your Loft</a> </p>
       
     <h2> The Cost of Heat Loss Through the Roof (Localised Stats, Barking & Dagenham)  </h2>

         </p>  
         <ul> 
     <li> A poorly insulated loft can add £280–£450+ per year in wasted heating costs. </li>
     <li>  Homes with insulation below 150mm tend to lose heat 30–50% faster, and that forces  your boiler to run much longer than usual and more frequently.</li>
        </ul>



     So, for every £1 spent on heating, a poorly insulated loft could potentially be leaking 40–60p straight into the sky.

     By comparison, upgrading to modern 270mm insulation can reduce heat loss by up to 25%.  </p>

     </ul>

    <h2> How Much You Can Actually Save After Upgrading Your Loft Insulation </h2>

       <li>   For many households, the insulation pays for itself in a time period of 1–3 years; this makes it one of the fastest ROI home improvements.  </li>

         </ul>
