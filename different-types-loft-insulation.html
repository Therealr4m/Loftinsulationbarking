    <p class="seo-intro">
      Choosing the right loft insulation makes a big difference to comfort, energy savings and long-term performance.
      Below is a clear breakdown of the most common insulation types used in Barking & Dagenham homes — including their pros, trade-offs and when each works best.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Quick overview</h2>
    <p>
      In most UK lofts, four main insulation solutions are used: <strong>mineral wool (Rockwool), fibreglass, quilted insulation rolls and spray foam</strong>.
      Each option varies in cost, lifespan, fire resistance and thermal performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best choice often depends on your property type, loft condition and whether you're upgrading older insulation or starting fresh.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Mineral wool (Rockwool)</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Dense mineral fibre insulation supplied as rolls or slabs, fitted between and over joists.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it performs well:</strong> Excellent fire resistance, strong acoustic properties and consistent thermal performance over time.</p>
    <p>
      For many older terraced and semi-detached homes in Barking, mineral wool provides a durable and reliable long-term solution.
      It holds its structure well and is less likely to degrade compared to lighter materials.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Typical cost range:</strong> Mid-range, but strong long-term value.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Fibreglass</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Lightweight glass-fibre rolls laid across the loft floor.</p>
    <p><strong>Why homeowners choose it:</strong> One of the most affordable professional options with good thermal performance when installed to the correct depth.</p>
    <p>
      Fibreglass works well for straightforward loft layouts and budget-conscious upgrades.
      The key is proper installation — evenly laid, no gaps, and no compression.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Quilted / insulation rolls (yellow rolls)</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Pre-formed quilted rolls commonly seen in UK lofts.</p>
    <p>
      These are widely used because they’re accessible, practical and effective when layered to modern depth standards (typically around 270mm total).
    </p>
    <p>
      In many Barking loft insulation upgrades, existing thin layers are simply topped up with additional rolls to improve overall thermal resistance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Spray foam</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Liquid polyurethane sprayed into roof spaces where it expands and hardens into an airtight foam layer.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> High thermal performance per millimetre and excellent air sealing.</p>
    <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Higher cost, requires specialist installation, and may affect future roof work or mortgage approvals if not installed correctly.</p>
    <p>
      Spray foam is typically suited to specific loft designs rather than standard cold loft floor insulation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Which insulation is best for Barking homes?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple, cost-effective upgrades:</strong> Fibreglass or quilted rolls.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term durability and fire safety:</strong> Mineral wool.</li>
      <li><strong>Specialist airtight solutions:</strong> Spray foam (professional assessment required).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many properties across Barking & Dagenham were built before modern insulation standards.
      That means upgrading to the correct depth — regardless of material — often delivers immediate comfort improvements and noticeable energy savings.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why correct installation matters more than the material</h2>
    <p>
      Even the best insulation underperforms if it’s compressed, uneven or poorly fitted.
      Gaps around eaves, compressed layers under stored items or insufficient depth reduce thermal performance significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Properly installed Barking loft insulation should be evenly distributed, ventilated correctly and laid to current recommended depth standards.
      This is what ensures you actually receive the savings and comfort improvements people expect.
