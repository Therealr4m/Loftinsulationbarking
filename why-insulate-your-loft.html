    <h2>Top reasons to insulate</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prevent heat loss:</strong> up to 25% of home heat is lost through an uninsulated loft.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower bills:</strong> insulation typically pays back within 2–4 years through energy savings.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect your home:</strong> reduces condensation and damp, protecting roof timbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> reduces upstairs drafts and evens out temperatures throughout your property.</li>
    </ol>
