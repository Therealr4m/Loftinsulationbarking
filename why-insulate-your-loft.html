    <ol>

      <li><strong>Lower bills:</strong> insulation typically pays back within 2–4 years through energy savings.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect your home:</strong> reduces condensation and damp, protecting roof timbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> reduces upstairs drafts and evens out temperatures throughout your property.</li>

  <h2>Why Loft Insulation Makes Such a Big Difference</h2>

  <p>
    Loft insulation works because heat naturally rises. In homes across Barking & Dagenham,
    an uninsulated or under-insulated loft allows warm air to escape straight through the roof.
    This means your heating has to work harder just to keep rooms at a comfortable temperature.
  </p>

  <p>
    By insulating the loft properly, you create a barrier that slows heat loss.
    This keeps warmth inside the living space for longer, reduces temperature drops upstairs,
    and helps the whole home feel more consistent.

  <h2>Why Older Homes Benefit the Most</h2>

  <p>
    Many homes in Barking & Dagenham were built before modern insulation standards existed.
    It’s very common to find lofts with thin insulation, patchy coverage,
    or materials that have degraded over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In these properties, insulating the loft is often one of the most effective upgrades you can make.
    It improves comfort immediately and addresses issues like cold bedrooms,
    condensation, and rising heating costs.
  </p>

  <h2>Long-Term Protection for Your Property</h2>

  <p>
    Insulating your loft isn’t just about warmth — it also helps protect the structure of your home.
    When warm air escapes into a cold loft, condensation can form.
    Over time, this moisture can affect roof timbers and insulation materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proper insulation helps stabilise temperatures and reduces the risk of condensation,
    supporting a healthier roof space and extending the life of key structural components.
